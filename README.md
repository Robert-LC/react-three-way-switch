## React-Three-Way-Switch

A three option toggle switch for React using TypeScript.

## Motivation

No one had a triple toggle switch available, and if I'm going to make one for myself, I might as well save everyone else precious time and share it.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-three-way-switch
```
